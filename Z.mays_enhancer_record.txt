BACKGROUND: Mediator is a conserved transcriptional co-activator that links
transcription factors bound at enhancer elements to RNA Polymerase II.
Mediator-RNA Polymerase II interactions can be sterically hindered by the Cyclin 
Dependent Kinase 8 (CDK8) module, a submodule of Mediator that acts to repress
transcription in response to discrete cellular and environmental cues. The CDK8
module is conserved in all eukaryotes and consists of 4 proteins: CDK8, CYCLIN C 
(CYCC), MED12, and MED13.
METHODS: In this study, we have characterized the CDK8 module of Mediator in
maize using genomic, molecular and functional resources.
RESULTS: The maize genome contains single copy genes for Cdk8, CycC, and Med13,
and two genes for Med12. Analysis of expression data for the CDK8 module
demonstrated that all five genes are broadly expressed in maize tissues, and
change their expression in response to phosphate and nitrogen limitation. We
performed Dissociation (Ds) insertional mutagenesis, recovering two independent
insertions in the ZmMed12a gene, one of which produces a truncated transcript.
CONCLUSIONS: Our molecular identification of the maize CDK8 module, assays of
CDK8 module expression under nutrient limitation, and characterization of
transposon insertions in ZmMed12a establish the basis for molecular and
functional studies of the role of these important transcriptional regulators in
development and nutrient homeostasis in Zea mays.

Enhancers are cis-acting DNA segments with the ability to increase target gene
expression. They show high sensitivity to DNase and contain specific DNA elements
in an open chromatin state that allows the binding of transcription factors
(TFs). While numerous enhancers are annotated in the maize genome, few have been 
characterized genetically. KERNEL ROW NUMBER4 (KRN4), an intergenic quantitative 
trait locus for kernel row number, is assumed to be a cis-regulatory element of
UNBRANCHED3 (UB3), a key inflorescence gene. However, the mechanism by which KRN4
controls UB3 expression remains unclear. Here, we found that KRN4 exhibits an
open chromatin state, harboring sequences that showed high enhancer activity
toward the 35S and UB3 promoters. KRN4 is bound by UB2-centered transcription
complexes and interacts with the UB3 promoter by three duplex interactions to
affect UB3 expression. Sequence variation at KRN4 enhances ub2 and ub3 mutant ear
fasciation. Therefore, we suggest that KRN4 functions as a distal enhancer of the
UB3 promoter via chromatin interactions and recruitment of UB2-centered
transcription complexes for the fine-tuning of UB3 expression in meristems of ear
inflorescences. These results provide evidence that an intergenic region helps to
finely tune gene expression, providing a new perspective on the genetic control
of quantitative traits.

Auxin plays a key role across all land plants in growth and developmental
processes. Although auxin signaling function has diverged and expanded,
differences in the molecular functions of signaling components have largely been 
characterized in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Here, we used the nuclear
Auxin Response Circuit recapitulated in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) system
to functionally annotate maize (Zea mays) auxin signaling components, focusing on
genes expressed during the development of ear and tassel inflorescences. All 16
maize auxin/indole-3-acetic acid repressor proteins were degraded in response to 
auxin with rates that depended on both receptor and repressor identities. When
fused to the maize TOPLESS homolog RAMOSA1 ENHANCER LOCUS2, maize
auxin/indole-3-acetic acids were able to repress AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR
transcriptional activity. A complete auxin response circuit comprising all maize 
components, including the ZmAFB2/3 b1 maize AUXIN SIGNALING F-BOX (AFB) receptor,
was fully functional. The ZmAFB2/3 b1 auxin receptor was more sensitive to
hormone than AtAFB2 and allowed for rapid circuit activation upon auxin addition.
These results validate the conserved role of predicted auxin response genes in
maize as well as provide evidence that a synthetic approach can facilitate
broader comparative studies across the wide range of species with sequenced
genomes.

This study reports enhanced efficacy of encapsulated α-Terpineol to control
fungal, aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) and free radicals mediated deterioration of stored
maize samples. The α-Terpineol loaded chitosan nanoemulsion (α-TCsNe) was
characterized through SEM, FTIR and XRD techniques. The α-TCsNe exhibited
enhanced antifungal activity against aflatoxin secreting strain of Aspergillus
flavus (AF-LHP-S1) and 12 other food borne moulds as well as AFB1 production at
0.4 and 0.3 µL/mL, respectively. Further, α-TCsNe inhibited ergosterol synthesis,
methylglyoxal (the aflatoxin enhancer) content and enhanced cellular contents
release. α-TCsNe showed enhanced radical scavenging activity with IC50 value
equivalent to 39.57 and 6.23 µL/mL for DPPH and ABTS, respectively. In addition, 
α-TCsNe completely inhibited AFB1 production in stored maize samples during in
situ investigation. Overall, α-TCsNe holds a promising potential and can be
recommended as a novel antifungal preservative to improve the shelf-life of
stored maize samples against fungal and aflatoxin contamination.

Genetic mapping studies on crops suggest that agronomic traits can be controlled 
by gene-distal intergenic loci. Despite the biological importance and the
potential agronomic utility of these loci, they remain virtually uncharacterized 
in all crop species to date. Here, we provide genetic, epigenomic and functional 
molecular evidence to support the widespread existence of gene-distal (hereafter,
distal) loci that act as long-range transcriptional cis-regulatory elements
(CREs) in the maize genome. Such loci are enriched for euchromatic features that 
suggest their regulatory functions. Chromatin loops link together putative CREs
with genes and recapitulate genetic interactions. Putative CREs also display
elevated transcriptional enhancer activities, as measured by self-transcribing
active regulatory region sequencing. These results provide functional support for
the widespread existence of CREs that act over large genomic distances to control
gene expression.

Chromatin loops connect regulatory elements to their target genes. They serve as 
bridges between transcriptional regulation and phenotypic variation in mammals.
However, spatial organization of regulatory elements and its impact on gene
expression in plants remain unclear. Here, we characterize epigenetic features of
active promoter proximal regions and candidate distal regulatory elements to
construct high-resolution chromatin interaction maps for maize via long-read
chromatin interaction analysis by paired-end tag sequencing (ChIA-PET). The maps 
indicate that chromatin loops are formed between regulatory elements, and that
gene pairs between promoter proximal regions tend to be co-expressed. The maps
also demonstrated the topological basis of quantitative trait loci which
influence gene expression and phenotype. Many promoter proximal regions are
involved in chromatin loops with distal regulatory elements, which regulate
important agronomic traits. Collectively, these maps provide a high-resolution
view of 3D maize genome architecture, and its role in gene expression and
phenotypic variation.

The chemical characterisation of Pimenta dioica essential oil (PDEO) revealed the
presence of 50 components, amongst which α-Terpineol (30.31%) was the major
component followed by β-Linalool (6.75%) and γ-Terpinene (4.64%). The oil
completely inhibited the growth of aflatoxin B1 secreting strain Aspergillus
flavus LHP-VS-8 and aflatoxin B1 production at 2.5 µL/mL and 1.5 µL/mL,
respectively. The oil caused dose dependent reduction of methylglyoxal (an AFB1
inducer), enhanced leakage of Ca2+, Mg2+ and K+ ions and significantly reduced
ergosterol content of fungal plasma membrane. During in situ experiments, PDEO
exhibited complete protection of fumigated maize cob slices from fungal
infestation without affecting seed germination. The chemically characterised PDEO
is recommended as a plant based preservative and shelf life enhancer of food
commodities by preventing fungal growth, AFB1 production and lipid peroxidation. 
This is the first report on PDEO as inhibitor of AFB1 secretion and methylglyoxal
biosynthesis.

Transcriptional repression in multicellular organisms orchestrates dynamic and
precise gene expression changes that enable complex developmental patterns. Here,
we present phenotypic and molecular characterization of the maize (Zea mays)
transcriptional corepressor RAMOSA1 ENHANCER LOCUS2 (REL2), a unique member of
the highly conserved TOPLESS (TPL) family. Analysis of single recessive mutations
in rel2 revealed an array of vegetative and reproductive phenotypes, many related
to defects in meristem initiation and maintenance. To better understand how
REL2-mediated transcriptional complexes relate to rel2 phenotypes, we performed
protein interaction assays and transcriptional profiling of mutant
inflorescences, leading to the identification of different maize transcription
factors and regulatory pathways that employ REL2 repression to control traits
directly impacting maize yields. In addition, we used our REL2 interaction data
to catalog conserved repression motifs present on REL2 interactors and showed
that two of these, RLFGV- and DLN-type motifs, interact with the C-terminal WD40 
domain of REL2 rather than the N terminus, which is known to bind LxLxL EAR
motifs. These findings establish that the WD40 domain of TPL family proteins is
an independent protein interaction surface that may work together with the
N-terminal domain to allow the formation of large macromolecular complexes of
functionally related transcription factors.

Fermentation has attracted increasing attention in pig industry, because of low
costs and numerous benefits on pig growth and health as well as environmental
improvement, although the mechanisms remain largely unknown. In the present
study, fermented corn-soybean meal significantly improved average daily gain and 
gain:food ratio (P < 0.05). Fermented feed (FF) significantly increased
insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) transcription in liver (P < 0.05). Meanwhile,
fermented meal significantly enhanced the binding of CCAAT/enhancer-binding
protein beta (C/EBPβ) to IGF1 promoter and C/EBPβ expression in liver (both P <
0.05). FF tended to increase IGF1 proteins in liver and serum too (both 0.05 < P 
< 0.10). Meanwhile, FF slightly but significantly increased hepatic and
circulating triglyceride and total cholesterol levels, as well as serum ratio of 
high-density to low-density cholesterol (all P < 0.05). Our data indicated that
FF could significantly augment the binding of C/EBPβ to IGF1 promoter and promote
hepatic IGF1 expression and production, thus boost pig growth.

Forward genetics remains a powerful method for revealing the genes underpinning
organismal form and function, and for revealing how these genes are tied together
in gene networks. In maize, forward genetics has been tremendously successful,
but the size and complexity of the maize genome made identifying mutant genes an 
often arduous process with traditional methods. The next generation sequencing
revolution has allowed for the gene cloning process to be significantly
accelerated in many organisms, even when genomes are large and complex. Here, we 
describe a bulked-segregant analysis sequencing (BSA-Seq) protocol for cloning
mutant genes in maize. Our simple strategy can be used to quickly identify a
mapping interval and candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from whole 
genome sequencing of pooled F2 individuals. We employed this strategy to identify
narrow odd dwarf as an enhancer of teosinte branched1, and to identify a new
allele of defective kernel1 Our method provides a quick, simple way to clone
genes in maize.

Obesity is a significant risk factor for various diseases. It is a clinical
condition caused by the excessive accumulation of fat, which has a negative
impact on human health. Galactin-12 is an adipocyte-expressed protein and
possesses adipocyte-inducing activity. We investigated the expression level of
candidate proteins involved in galactin-12-mediated adipocyte differentiation
pathway. We performed a high-throughput screening assay to monitor galectin-12
promoter activity using 105 traditional Chinese herbs. Corn silk extract and
[Formula: see text]-sitosterol reduced the expression of galactin-12 promoter in 
3T3-L1 cells. In addition, corn silk extract and [Formula: see text]-sitosterol
decreased the level of lipid droplets and downregulated the gene and protein
expression level of C/EBP[Formula: see text], C/EBP[Formula: see text],
PPAR[Formula: see text], Ap2, and adipsin in 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes via AKT and
ERK1/2 inhibition. In vivo study with the oral administration of corn silk
extract and [Formula: see text]-sitosterol in a mouse model showed a significant 
weight reduction and decrease in adipocytes in several organs such as the liver
and adipose tissue. Taken together, corn silk extract and [Formula: see
text]-sitosterol may effectively reduce pre-adipocyte differentiation by
inhibiting galectin-12 activity and exerting anti-obesity effects. These findings
highlight the potential use of corn silk extract and [Formula: see
text]-sitosterol as potential candidates for the prevention and treatment of
obesity.

Borş is a traditional Romanian beverage obtained by naturally fermenting an
aqueous suspension of wheat bran and corn flour, used as flavoring enhancer in
local gastronomy since ancient times, and more recently consumed as refreshing
drink. To investigate the changes in sensory, physico-chemical, phenolic and
aroma composition resulted after two successive fermentations, borș samples were 
subjected to standard, sensory, HPLC and GC/MS analysis. Total phenolic compounds
and ferulic acid, the most abundant phenolic compound, were positively influenced
by natural starter addition, increase of fermentation temperature, and thermal
treatment, whereas the effect on less abundant phenolic acids was not univocal.
The variables had the same effect on antioxidant activity and brown index.
Volatiles (alcohols, carboxylic acids, esters), pungent-sour and goat milk-cheese
odor notes increased at higher fermentation temperature, whereas bran and yogurt 
odor notes decreased. The addition of a natural starter at 4 °C allowed balancing

Due to requirement of novel memory enhancer for menopausal women, this study
aimed to determine safety and effect of the functional drink containing the
extracts of purple corn cob and pandan leaves (PCP) on memory and brain changes
in experimental menopause induced by bilateral ovariectomy (OVX). Acute toxicity 
of PCP was carried out in female Wistar rats. The results showed that LD50 was
more than 2000 mg/kg BW. To determine the cognitive enhancing effect of PCP, OVX 
rats were orally treated with PCP at the doses of 20, 40, and 80 mg/kg BW for 28 
days. The spatial memory was assessed every 7 days throughout the study period.
At the end of the study, oxidative stress status, acetylcholinesterase (AChE)
activity, monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity, neuronal density, and extracellular
signal regulated protein kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) signaling in hippocampus were
measured. The improved spatial memory, ERK1/2 expression, and neuron density in
dentate gyrus of hippocampus were observed in PCP-treated rats. In addition, a
reduction of AChE activity was also observed. Unfortunately, no improved
oxidative stress status was observed. Taken altogether, PCP exerts the
memory-enhancing effect partly through the suppression of AChE and the increase
in ERK signaling in the hippocampus.

Genomic regions free of nucleosomes, which are hypersensitive to DNase I
digestion, are known as DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs) and frequently
contain cis-regulatory DNA elements. To investigate their prevalence and
characteristics in maize (Zea mays), we developed high-resolution genome-wide DHS
maps using a modified DNase-seq technique. Maize DHSs exhibit depletion of
nucleosomes and low levels of DNA methylation and are enriched with conserved
noncoding sequences (CNSs). We developed a protoplast-based transient
transformation assay to assess the potential gene expression enhancer and/or
promoter functions associated with DHSs, which showed that more than 80% of DHSs 
overlapping with CNSs showed an enhancer function. Strikingly, nearly 25% of
maize DHSs were derived from transposable elements (TEs), including both class I 
and class II transposons. Interestingly, TE-derived DHSs (teDHSs) homologous to
retrotransposons were enriched with sequences related to the intrinsic
cis-regulatory elements within the long terminal repeats of retrotransposons. We 
demonstrate that more than 80% of teDHSs can drive transcription of a reporter
gene in protoplast assays. These results reveal the widespread occurrence of
TE-derived cis-regulatory sequences and suggest that teDHSs play a major role in 
transcriptional regulation in maize.
